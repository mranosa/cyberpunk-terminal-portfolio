            In Vedic astrology, <span className="text-white font-semibold">Surya</span> (the Sun) is not merely a planet ‚Äî it is the 
            <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">soul's essence</span>, the divine spark of consciousness that animates your entire being. 
            The Sun represents your <span className="text-white font-semibold">Atman</span> (eternal self), your connection to cosmic consciousness, 
            and the unique ray of divine light you're meant to embody in this incarnation.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The Sun governs <span className="text-yellow-300">willpower, vitality, authority, and purpose</span>. It is the king of the planetary cabinet,

            <span className="text-white font-semibold">dharma</span> ‚Äî your cosmic duty, your soul's assignment in this lifetime.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Unlike other planets that give results through circumstances, the Sun shapes your <span className="text-white font-semibold">essential nature</span>. 
            It doesn't just influence what happens to you; it determines <span className="text-white font-semibold">who you are at the core</span>. 
            The Sun's placement reveals where you're meant to shine, lead, and illuminate the path for others.

          ‚ôì SUN IN PISCES ‚Äî THE MYSTIC SOVEREIGN
        </h4>
        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Pisces, the final sign of the zodiac, is where <span className="text-white font-semibold">all boundaries dissolve</span>. 
            Ruled by <span className="text-cyan-300">Jupiter</span> (traditional) and co-ruled by Neptune (modern), this mutable water sign represents the 
            <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">ocean of consciousness</span> itself ‚Äî vast, mysterious, all-encompassing. 
            It is the sign of <span className="text-white">moksha (liberation)</span>, where the soul remembers its divine nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Sun, that symbol of individual identity and ego-consciousness, enters Pisces, something magical and challenging occurs: 
            <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">the ego learns to dissolve without disappearing</span>. This is the placement of the 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">mystic leader</span>, the <span className="text-white font-semibold">compassionate authority</span>, 
            the artist-king who rules through inspiration rather than domination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Sun in Pisces makes you a <span className="text-white font-semibold">spiritual warrior disguised as a dreamer</span>. The water element 
            softens the Sun's natural fire, creating a gentle steam that can heal or obscure. You possess an unusual gift: the ability to be simultaneously 
            <span className="text-cyan-300">strong and surrendered</span>, <span className="text-cyan-300">authoritative and empathetic</span>, 
            <span className="text-cyan-300">individual and universal</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shadow work here involves the temptation to <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">escape rather than embody</span>. 
            Pisces can use illusion as armor, preferring the safety of dreams to the vulnerability of manifestation. Your spiritual evolution requires you to be 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">the lighthouse</span> ‚Äî fully anchored in transcendent waters while providing clear guidance to those 
            still navigating the storms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white font-semibold">
            The mastery of Sun in Pisces is to become a <span className="text-cyan-300">living bridge between worlds</span> ‚Äî equally comfortable in boardrooms 
            and meditation halls, capable of translating mystical truth into practical wisdom. You're learning that true power comes not from asserting your 
            will but from <span className="text-cyan-300">aligning with divine will</span>.

            Your Sun resides in Uttarabhadra, a nakshatra that spans the end of Pisces. Its symbol, the 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">back legs of a funeral cot</span>, represents the ability to bear the weight of collective karma with grace. 
            The deity <span className="text-white font-semibold">Ahir Budhnya</span>, the serpent of the deep, represents the kundalini force that lies coiled 
            in the depths of consciousness, waiting to rise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ruled by Saturn, Uttarabhadra grants the <span className="text-pink-300 font-semibold">patience of the sage and the discipline of the monk</span>. 
            This is not the flashy spirituality of quick enlightenment but the slow, steady burn of genuine realization. Your soul carries the markings of one who 
            has walked the path many times ‚Äî you have the <span className="text-white font-semibold">gravitas of ancient wisdom</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <span className="text-pink-300 font-semibold">Pada 2</span> (Virgo navamsa), your Sun gains Mercury's analytical precision. This is the pada of 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">practical mysticism</span> ‚Äî you're not content with vague spiritual platitudes. You need your transcendence to be 
            <span className="text-white">useful, applicable, healing</span>. The Virgo influence makes you a spiritual perfectionist, someone who refines consciousness 
            like a master craftsman polishes a sacred stone.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-white font-semibold">
            "This is the soul of the spiritual teacher who emphasizes practice over theory, the healer who knows that God is in the details, 
            the mystic who brings heaven to earth through meticulous dedication."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Uttarabhadra Sun in Pada 2 creates a powerful dynamic: you have the <span className="text-white font-semibold">depth of Pisces</span>, 
            the <span className="text-white font-semibold">discipline of Saturn</span>, and the <span className="text-white font-semibold">discrimination of Virgo</span>. 
            Your medicine is the ability to take the vastness of spiritual truth and distill it into <span className="text-pink-300">precise, practical wisdom</span>

            suggests you've been in positions of power before, perhaps many times. You carry the <span className="text-orange-300 font-semibold">cellular memory of 
            leadership</span>, but also the wisdom of its limitations. You know, at a soul level, that all worldly power is temporary.

            Ketu's influence makes you naturally <span className="text-white font-semibold">detached from the very success you're meant to achieve</span>. 
            You can reach great heights professionally because you're not desperately grasping for them. This detachment is your

            compromise your integrity, to choose dharma over profit.

            Your dharma is to demonstrate that <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">success and spirituality are not opposites</span>, 
            that one can be powerful and compassionate, visible and humble, authoritative and surrendered. You're here to show that the mystic

          <p>
            This aspect creates a powerful dynamic: your <span className="text-green-300 font-semibold">emotions directly shape your identity</span>. 
            There's no hiding how you feel ‚Äî your emotional state radiates through your very being. This makes you

          </p>
          <p>
            The Moon's aspect to the Ascendant means your <span className="text-white font-semibold">physical body responds to emotional states</span>.

            The Moon in you is learning its ultimate lesson: <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">emotional mastery comes not from 
            controlling feelings but from understanding their sacred purpose</span>. Your emotions are meant to be bridges ‚Äî connecting 
            you to others, to truth, to the divine.

          <p className="text-white italic">

            <span className="text-purple-300">friendships, networks, aspirations, and collective consciousness</span>. It's where individual effort

            Your Mars in Aries in the 11th house, in Krittika nakshatra, is your <span className="text-white font-semibold">soul's divine weapon</span> 
            for cutting through collective karma and pioneering new paths for humanity. You chose this configuration to be a

            You are a <span className="text-red-300 font-semibold">network warrior</span> in an age that needs collective courage. 
            Your Aries Mars gives you the pure fire to initiate change, while your 11th house placement ensures that change serves the collective good.

            ensures your battles serve truth.
