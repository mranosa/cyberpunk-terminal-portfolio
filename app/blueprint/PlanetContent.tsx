            In Vedic astrology, <span className="text-white font-semibold">Surya</span> (the Sun) is not merely a planet ‚Äî it is the 
            <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">soul's essence</span>, the divine spark of consciousness that animates your entire being. 
            The Sun represents your <span className="text-white font-semibold">Atman</span> (eternal self), your connection to cosmic consciousness, 
            and the unique ray of divine light you're meant to embody in this incarnation.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The Sun governs <span className="text-yellow-300">willpower, vitality, authority, and purpose</span>. It is the king of the planetary cabinet,

            <span className="text-white font-semibold">dharma</span> ‚Äî your cosmic duty, your soul's assignment in this lifetime.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Unlike other planets that give results through circumstances, the Sun shapes your <span className="text-white font-semibold">essential nature</span>. 
            It doesn't just influence what happens to you; it determines <span className="text-white font-semibold">who you are at the core</span>. 
            The Sun's placement reveals where you're meant to shine, lead, and illuminate the path for others.

          ‚ôì SUN IN PISCES ‚Äî THE MYSTIC SOVEREIGN
        </h4>
        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Pisces, the final sign of the zodiac, is where <span className="text-white font-semibold">all boundaries dissolve</span>. 
            Ruled by <span className="text-cyan-300">Jupiter</span> (traditional) and co-ruled by Neptune (modern), this mutable water sign represents the 
            <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">ocean of consciousness</span> itself ‚Äî vast, mysterious, all-encompassing. 
            It is the sign of <span className="text-white">moksha (liberation)</span>, where the soul remembers its divine nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Sun, that symbol of individual identity and ego-consciousness, enters Pisces, something magical and challenging occurs: 
            <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">the ego learns to dissolve without disappearing</span>. This is the placement of the 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">mystic leader</span>, the <span className="text-white font-semibold">compassionate authority</span>, 
            the artist-king who rules through inspiration rather than domination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Sun in Pisces makes you a <span className="text-white font-semibold">spiritual warrior disguised as a dreamer</span>. The water element 
            softens the Sun's natural fire, creating a gentle steam that can heal or obscure. You possess an unusual gift: the ability to be simultaneously 
            <span className="text-cyan-300">strong and surrendered</span>, <span className="text-cyan-300">authoritative and empathetic</span>, 
            <span className="text-cyan-300">individual and universal</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shadow work here involves the temptation to <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">escape rather than embody</span>. 
            Pisces can use illusion as armor, preferring the safety of dreams to the vulnerability of manifestation. Your spiritual evolution requires you to be 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">the lighthouse</span> ‚Äî fully anchored in transcendent waters while providing clear guidance to those 
            still navigating the storms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white font-semibold">
            The mastery of Sun in Pisces is to become a <span className="text-cyan-300">living bridge between worlds</span> ‚Äî equally comfortable in boardrooms 
            and meditation halls, capable of translating mystical truth into practical wisdom. You're learning that true power comes not from asserting your 
            will but from <span className="text-cyan-300">aligning with divine will</span>.

            Your Sun resides in Uttarabhadra, a nakshatra that spans the end of Pisces. Its symbol, the 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">back legs of a funeral cot</span>, represents the ability to bear the weight of collective karma with grace. 
            The deity <span className="text-white font-semibold">Ahir Budhnya</span>, the serpent of the deep, represents the kundalini force that lies coiled 
            in the depths of consciousness, waiting to rise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ruled by Saturn, Uttarabhadra grants the <span className="text-pink-300 font-semibold">patience of the sage and the discipline of the monk</span>. 
            This is not the flashy spirituality of quick enlightenment but the slow, steady burn of genuine realization. Your soul carries the markings of one who 
            has walked the path many times ‚Äî you have the <span className="text-white font-semibold">gravitas of ancient wisdom</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <span className="text-pink-300 font-semibold">Pada 2</span> (Virgo navamsa), your Sun gains Mercury's analytical precision. This is the pada of 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">practical mysticism</span> ‚Äî you're not content with vague spiritual platitudes. You need your transcendence to be 
            <span className="text-white">useful, applicable, healing</span>. The Virgo influence makes you a spiritual perfectionist, someone who refines consciousness 
            like a master craftsman polishes a sacred stone.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-white font-semibold">
            "This is the soul of the spiritual teacher who emphasizes practice over theory, the healer who knows that God is in the details, 
            the mystic who brings heaven to earth through meticulous dedication."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Uttarabhadra Sun in Pada 2 creates a powerful dynamic: you have the <span className="text-white font-semibold">depth of Pisces</span>, 
            the <span className="text-white font-semibold">discipline of Saturn</span>, and the <span className="text-white font-semibold">discrimination of Virgo</span>. 
            Your medicine is the ability to take the vastness of spiritual truth and distill it into <span className="text-pink-300">precise, practical wisdom</span>

            suggests you've been in positions of power before, perhaps many times. You carry the <span className="text-orange-300 font-semibold">cellular memory of 
            leadership</span>, but also the wisdom of its limitations. You know, at a soul level, that all worldly power is temporary.

            Ketu's influence makes you naturally <span className="text-white font-semibold">detached from the very success you're meant to achieve</span>. 
            You can reach great heights professionally because you're not desperately grasping for them. This detachment is your

            compromise your integrity, to choose dharma over profit.

            Your dharma is to demonstrate that <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">success and spirituality are not opposites</span>, 
            that one can be powerful and compassionate, visible and humble, authoritative and surrendered. You're here to show that the mystic

          <p>
            Your Moon casts its full aspect upon the 1st house ‚Äî your <span className="text-white font-semibold">Ascendant, 
            the dawn point of your chart</span>, representing your physical body, personality, and how you project yourself into the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            This aspect creates a powerful dynamic: your <span className="text-green-300 font-semibold">emotions directly shape your identity</span>. 
            There's no hiding how you feel ‚Äî your emotional state radiates through your very being. This makes you 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">authentically transparent</span>, incapable of sustained pretense.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moon's aspect to the Ascendant means your <span className="text-white font-semibold">physical body responds to emotional states</span>. 
            You literally embody your feelings. This can make you <span className="text-green-300">highly intuitive about your health</span> ‚Äî 
            your body tells you what your emotions need.
          </p>
          <p>
            This aspect grants tremendous gifts:<br/>
            ‚Ä¢ Your personality has <span className="text-green-300">magnetic emotional authenticity</span><br/>
            ‚Ä¢ People instinctively trust you because you cannot fake your feelings<br/>

          <p>
            The 7th-to-1st axis creates the <span className="text-white font-semibold">relationship-identity dynamic</span>: who you are (1st) 
            is deeply influenced by who you're with (7th). Your partnerships literally <span className="text-green-300 font-semibold">reshape your personality</span>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white font-semibold">
            This aspect suggests that your <span className="text-green-300">true self emerges through relationship</span>. You discover who you are 
            not in isolation but in the sacred dance of connection. Every partnership is an opportunity to birth a new aspect of yourself.

            "You are not here to escape your karma ‚Äî you are here to master it."
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Moon in Sagittarius in the 7th house, in Purvashadha nakshatra, is your <span className="text-white font-semibold">soul's conscious design</span> 
            for mastering the sacred art of conscious relationship. You chose this configuration to learn that 
            <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">wisdom comes through connection</span>, that truth is discovered in dialogue, 
            that the highest philosophy is love in action.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are a <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">relationship philosopher</span> in an age that desperately needs to understand 
            sacred partnership. Your Sagittarius Moon makes you optimistic enough to keep believing in love, while your 7th house placement 
            ensures you have the experience to make it real. Purvashadha gives you the <span className="text-white font-semibold">invincibility to persist</span> 
            when relationships challenge you, while the Leo pada ensures you never lose your sovereign self in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your dharma is to demonstrate that <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">relationships are spiritual paths</span>, 
            that partnership is a form of yoga, that every connection is an opportunity for consciousness expansion. You're here to show that 
            we don't lose ourselves in relationship ‚Äî we <span className="text-white font-semibold">discover ourselves through it</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moon in you is learning its ultimate lesson: <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">emotional mastery comes not from 
            controlling feelings but from understanding their sacred purpose</span>. Your emotions are meant to be bridges ‚Äî connecting 
            you to others, to truth, to the divine.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white italic">
            "You are the proof that the mystic path includes sacred partnership, that enlightenment can happen in embrace as easily as in solitude. 
            Your soul chose this configuration to remember: <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">we are not here to transcend relationship ‚Äî 
            we are here to make relationship transcendent</span>."
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 font-semibold text-base mt-4">
            Your Moon whispers: "Feel without drowning. Connect without merging. Love without losing yourself. Be the philosopher who doesn't just 
            think about truth but feels it, the partner who doesn't just want love but becomes it. This is not your challenge ‚Äî this is your gift. 
            This is not your karma to endure ‚Äî this is your dharma to embody. And you, beloved soul, came here to show the world that the 
            greatest wisdom is an open heart."
