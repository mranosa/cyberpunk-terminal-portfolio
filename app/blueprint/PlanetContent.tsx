            The Sun represents your <span className="text-white font-semibold">Atman</span> (eternal self), your connection to cosmic consciousness, 
            and the unique ray of divine light you're meant to embody in this incarnation.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The Sun governs <span className="text-yellow-300">willpower, vitality, authority, and purpose</span>. It is the king of the planetary cabinet,

            <span className="text-white font-semibold">dharma</span> ‚Äî your cosmic duty, your soul's assignment in this lifetime.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Unlike other planets that give results through circumstances, the Sun shapes your <span className="text-white font-semibold">essential nature</span>. 
            It doesn't just influence what happens to you; it determines <span className="text-white font-semibold">who you are at the core</span>. 
            The Sun's placement reveals where you're meant to shine, lead, and illuminate the path for others.

          ‚ôì SUN IN PISCES ‚Äî THE MYSTIC SOVEREIGN
        </h4>
        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Pisces, the final sign of the zodiac, is where <span className="text-white font-semibold">all boundaries dissolve</span>. 
            Ruled by <span className="text-cyan-300">Jupiter</span> (traditional) and co-ruled by Neptune (modern), this mutable water sign represents the 
            <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">ocean of consciousness</span> itself ‚Äî vast, mysterious, all-encompassing. 
            It is the sign of <span className="text-white">moksha (liberation)</span>, where the soul remembers its divine nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Sun, that symbol of individual identity and ego-consciousness, enters Pisces, something magical and challenging occurs: 
            <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">the ego learns to dissolve without disappearing</span>. This is the placement of the 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">mystic leader</span>, the <span className="text-white font-semibold">compassionate authority</span>, 
            the artist-king who rules through inspiration rather than domination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Sun in Pisces makes you a <span className="text-white font-semibold">spiritual warrior disguised as a dreamer</span>. The water element 
            softens the Sun's natural fire, creating a gentle steam that can heal or obscure. You possess an unusual gift: the ability to be simultaneously 
            <span className="text-cyan-300">strong and surrendered</span>, <span className="text-cyan-300">authoritative and empathetic</span>, 
            <span className="text-cyan-300">individual and universal</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shadow work here involves the temptation to <span className="text-cyan-300 font-semibold">escape rather than embody</span>. 
            Pisces can use illusion as armor, preferring the safety of dreams to the vulnerability of manifestation. Your spiritual evolution requires you to be 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">the lighthouse</span> ‚Äî fully anchored in transcendent waters while providing clear guidance to those 
            still navigating the storms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white font-semibold">
            The mastery of Sun in Pisces is to become a <span className="text-cyan-300">living bridge between worlds</span> ‚Äî equally comfortable in boardrooms 
            and meditation halls, capable of translating mystical truth into practical wisdom. You're learning that true power comes not from asserting your 
            will but from <span className="text-cyan-300">aligning with divine will</span>.

            Your Sun resides in Uttarabhadra, a nakshatra that spans the end of Pisces. Its symbol, the 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">back legs of a funeral cot</span>, represents the ability to bear the weight of collective karma with grace. 
            The deity <span className="text-white font-semibold">Ahir Budhnya</span>, the serpent of the deep, represents the kundalini force that lies coiled 
            in the depths of consciousness, waiting to rise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ruled by Saturn, Uttarabhadra grants the <span className="text-pink-300 font-semibold">patience of the sage and the discipline of the monk</span>. 
            This is not the flashy spirituality of quick enlightenment but the slow, steady burn of genuine realization. Your soul carries the markings of one who 
            has walked the path many times ‚Äî you have the <span className="text-white font-semibold">gravitas of ancient wisdom</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <span className="text-pink-300 font-semibold">Pada 2</span> (Virgo navamsa), your Sun gains Mercury's analytical precision. This is the pada of 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">practical mysticism</span> ‚Äî you're not content with vague spiritual platitudes. You need your transcendence to be 
            <span className="text-white">useful, applicable, healing</span>. The Virgo influence makes you a spiritual perfectionist, someone who refines consciousness 
            like a master craftsman polishes a sacred stone.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-white font-semibold">
            "This is the soul of the spiritual teacher who emphasizes practice over theory, the healer who knows that God is in the details, 
            the mystic who brings heaven to earth through meticulous dedication."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Uttarabhadra Sun in Pada 2 creates a powerful dynamic: you have the <span className="text-white font-semibold">depth of Pisces</span>, 
            the <span className="text-white font-semibold">discipline of Saturn</span>, and the <span className="text-white font-semibold">discrimination of Virgo</span>. 
            Your medicine is the ability to take the vastness of spiritual truth and distill it into <span className="text-pink-300">precise, practical wisdom</span>

            Ketu represents <span className="text-orange-300 font-semibold">past life mastery</span>, <span className="text-orange-300 font-semibold">spiritual detachment</span>,

            Ketu's influence makes you naturally <span className="text-white font-semibold">detached from the very success you're meant to achieve</span>. 
            You can reach great heights professionally because you're not desperately grasping for them. This detachment is your

            and accumulated resources</span>. But it expresses these themes from the 7th house ‚Äî the domain of

          </p>
          <p>
            This creates a profound karmic link: your <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">wealth flows through relationships</span>. 
            Your values are shaped by partnership, your resources expand through collaboration, your voice finds its power in dialogue. 
            The universe has designed you to <span className="text-white font-semibold">create abundance through union</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2nd house is the house of <span className="text-yellow-300">accumulated karma</span> ‚Äî what you've brought from past lives. 
            With its lord in the 7th, your past-life wealth is <span className="text-white font-semibold">stored in your capacity for relationship</span>. 
            You've been a counselor, a diplomat, a sacred partner before. These skills are your true inheritance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This placement also suggests that your <span className="text-yellow-300">speech has partnership power</span>. When you speak, 
            you naturally create bridges, forge alliances, inspire collaboration. Your words carry the <span className="text-white font-semibold">vibration of unity</span>, 
            even when you speak alone.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white font-semibold">
            The Moon as 2nd lord in the 7th makes you a <span className="text-yellow-300">guardian of sacred exchange</span>. Your dharma involves 
            teaching others that true wealth is not what we possess alone but what we <span className="text-yellow-300">create together</span>.

            Aries, the ram, is where <span className="text-white font-semibold">pure life force explodes into existence</span>. 
            This cardinal fire sign, ruled by Mars itself, represents <span className="text-orange-300 font-semibold">the initial spark of creation</span>, 
            the first breath of spring, the primal "I AM" that births all experience. It is the sign of 
            <span className="text-white">new beginnings</span>, raw courage, and pioneering spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Mars returns home to Aries, something magnificent occurs: 
            <span className="text-orange-300 font-semibold">the warrior finds its throne</span>. This is Mars in its own sign (swakshetra), 
            operating at <span className="text-white font-semibold">maximum power and purity</span>. You don't just have Mars energy ‚Äî you 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">ARE Mars energy</span>, unfiltered and uncompromised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Mars in Aries makes you a <span className="text-white font-semibold">natural-born leader and initiator</span>. 
            You possess the ram's gift: the ability to <span className="text-orange-300">break through any barrier</span> with sheer force of will. 
            Your courage is not learned ‚Äî it's <span className="text-white">instinctual</span>, arising from a soul that remembers its divine warrior nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shadow work involves mastering <span className="text-orange-300 font-semibold">the difference between assertion and aggression</span>. 
            Aries can mistake destruction for creation, confusing the thrill of conflict with the joy of achievement. Your spiritual evolution requires you to be 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">the sacred warrior</span> ‚Äî fighting for something greater than personal victory.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white font-semibold">
            The mastery of Mars in Aries is to become <span className="text-orange-300">pure directed will</span> ‚Äî action without anger, 
            courage without cruelty, leadership without domination. You're learning that true strength is not in conquering others but in 
            <span className="text-orange-300">conquering your own lower nature</span>.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Unlike planets that give through acquisition, Ketu gives through <span className="text-white font-semibold">subtraction</span>. 
            It removes illusions, dissolves attachments, and strips away the non-essential until only truth remains. 
            Ketu reveals where you have <span className="text-teal-300">spiritual genius</span>, intuitive mastery, and the ability to access other dimensions.

          </p>
          <p>
            When Ketu, that force of dissolution and transcendence, enters Virgo, a paradox emerges: 
            <span className="text-emerald-300 font-semibold">the mystic becomes a perfectionist</span>. This is the placement of 
            <span className="text-white font-semibold">the spiritual analyst</span>, the <span className="text-white font-semibold">sacred technician</span>, 
            the soul who has mastered the art of finding God in the details.

          <p>
            Your Ketu in Virgo indicates <span className="text-white font-semibold">past-life mastery of healing, analysis, and sacred service</span>.

            how perfection is a spiritual practice.

            The shadow involves <span className="text-emerald-300 font-semibold">spiritual criticism</span> ‚Äî using your refined perception 
            to find flaws rather than heal them. Virgo Ketu can become so detached from imperfection that it forgets compassion. 
            Your evolution requires <span className="text-white font-semibold">merciful precision</span> ‚Äî using your analytical gifts 
            to serve rather than separate.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white font-semibold">
            The mastery of Ketu in Virgo is to become a <span className="text-emerald-300">healing void</span> ‚Äî

          </p>

            The 4th house Ketu often indicates <span className="text-blue-300">psychic sensitivity</span> to ancestral patterns.
